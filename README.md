###目的

idea from [unitedstates/bill-nicknames](http://github.com/unitedstates/bill-nicknames)

###How it works
**bill_number** - 提案編號. (e.g. for "院總第 1044 號 委員提案第 13747 號", this would be "1044L13747")

**congress** - 提出此案的立院屆數. (e.g. for "第八屆", this would be 8)

**term** - 此案關聯名稱. 小寫,半形

**comment** - 解釋此案和關鍵字的關聯性

### Contributing

If you want to add entries, fork it, add away, and send a pull request. I'm inclined to take an inclusive approach, since false positives don't seem as bad as simply missing out on finding the bill someone was searching for altogether.

### License

Published under the public domain [Unlicense](/blob/master/LICENSE), no restrictions whatsoever.

However, if you split this off somewhere else and add your own expertise to it, please keep it public. Most ideally, keep it within Github, so that your additions can easily be seen and retrieved.
